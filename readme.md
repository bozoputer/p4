#Project 4 - Much To-do (Final project)


##Description
Much To-Do is a time-managment application that helps users organize their tasks into an easily-managed to-do list.

Much To-Do was created for the Harvard Extension School course, Dynamic Web Applications (CSCI E-15).

###Project goal:

+ Uses PHP/Laravel.
+ Uses a database with at least **2 tables**. This count does not include a users table, but does include pivot tables.
+ Demonstrates **all 4 CRUD interactions** (user signup/login does not count towards this).
+ Demonstrates basic server-side error validation.
